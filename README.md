# Web App Boilerplate
This project is my personal boilerplate for Single Page Web App.

Major Libraries include:
* React
* Redux
 * Redux Thunk - Create actions that return a thunk. Great for async actions.
 * Reselect - Memoize selectors to help reduce renders in your react tree
* React Router
 * React Redux Router - Keep route in the store and use actions to navigate from other actions.
* Lodash
